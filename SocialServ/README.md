# SocialServ

This is a simple implementation of a social network. It provides all standard functionality such as posting, liking, following, etc.

## Prerequisites:

- Install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) for your OS on default port

- This project is not supposed to be standalone, but rather used in our [platform application](https://github.com/Smunfr/sse-platform). Therefore you first need to install this platform. Follow the instructions in the repository.

## Installation

- you can install the social network's requirements using pip. simply execute:
  ```sh
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  Thats all you need to do.

## Running the social network

- for debugging and developing:
  start dummy_platform.py in a separate terminal:
  ```sh
  $ python3 dummy_platform.py
  ```
  In another terminal window, start the actual social network with the standalone flag:
  ```sh
  $ python3 main.py --standalone_dev
  ```
  In this mode no authentication is required and there are only dummy users for testing.

- for production situation:
  - fire up the platform application (please refer to the guide in the repo)
  - open up the platform in the browser and log in with the admin account       (important, only admin can start modules). This admin account has to be created with the --create_admin flag when starting the platform
  - If you have done everything correctly, you should see a list of available modules. Hit download on SocialServ. If it does not work on the first go, try again after some time, the Github API is mean sometimes.
  - after it is downloaded a "start" button should appear. Click it, and SocialServ will get started. Click on the port number to get redirected.
  - Now all users can see upon logging in to the platform the SocialServ is running and can redirect to it and use it.
